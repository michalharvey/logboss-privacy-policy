Privacy Policy
Effective Date: [04/28/2025]

Log Boss ("we", "our", "us") respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our mobile application ("App").
Please read this policy carefully. If you do not agree with the terms of this Privacy Policy, please do not access the App.

1. Information We Collect
We do not collect, store, or share personal data directly through our App.

However, the App may collect limited, non-personally identifiable information automatically for the purposes of app functionality, analytics, or advertising. This can include:

Device Information (model, operating system, language)

Usage Data (app opens, taps, screens viewed)

If any third-party services are integrated (e.g., ads or analytics providers), they may collect information as outlined in their own privacy policies.

2. Use of Your Information
We use any automatically collected information solely to:

Improve the functionality and performance of the App

Fix bugs or technical issues

Understand user engagement patterns (for app improvements)

We do not sell your information to third parties.

3. Sharing of Your Information
We may share limited information with service providers that support the App, such as:

Analytics providers (e.g., Google Analytics for Firebase)

Advertising networks (e.g., Google AdMob)

These third parties are bound by their own privacy policies and are only authorized to use your information as necessary to provide their services to us.

4. Third-Party Services
The App may link to or integrate third-party services not operated by us. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of these third parties. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of each third-party service you access.

Examples may include:

Google AdMob

Google Firebase Analytics

Apple Game Center

5. Data Retention
We do not store personal data from users on our servers. Any anonymous or aggregated data collected is retained only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy.

6. Security
We take reasonable administrative, technical, and physical precautions to protect your information. However, no security measures are 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.

7. Children's Privacy
This App is not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe that we have inadvertently collected such information, please contact us so that we can promptly delete it.
